This project that i have started is a project for school purposes.
# Game and Situation 
this game will be an RPG game that has levelling System in it.
its a Single player game and the game won't be big because we don't have much time
we as a Student in Business and IT don't have much time on our hands to code we have many tests we have to study for
in the first semester of this year we had 40+ tests in Business.
any tips or help would be very much appreciated.
